There are 55 axioms in scientology which are very demonstrably true, and on these can be constructed a great deal."},{"Quote":"We don't regard any scientific theory as the absolute truth."},{"Quote":"Science is the pursuit of pure truth, and the systematizing of it."},{"Quote":"If anyone offers conjectures about the truth of things from the mere possibility of hypotheses, I do not see by what stipulation anything certain can be determined in any science, since one or another set of hypotheses may always be devised which will appear to supply new difficulties."},{"Quote":"No one has a monopoly on truth, and science continues to advance. Yesterday's heresies may be tomorrow's conventional wisdom."},{"Quote":"Fiction is lies; we're writing about people who never existed and events that never happened when we write fiction, whether its science fiction or fantasy or western mystery stories or so-called literary stories.

The business of the poet is truth telling, which is why in the Celtic tradition no one could be a teacher unless he or she was a poet."},{"Quote":"There is no teacher, living or past, who can give us the actual understanding of Truth.

As long as you approach doing a remix with truth, I don't see the dance remixes being any different than an hip-hop remix- it's really a different version of the song."},{"Quote":"Our uniqueness makes us special, makes perception valuable - but it can also make us lonely. This loneliness is different from being 'alone': You can be lonely even surrounded by people. The feeling I'm talking about stems from the sense that we can never fully share the truth of who we are. I experienced this acutely at an early age."},{"Quote":"We live in an age where there is a firehose of information, and there is no hierarchy of what is important and what is not.

I would like to see a society that will bring happiness to all life forms. Of course, to the Nazis, I appear a rebel, but to the rebels, I appear like a normal person from Venus."},{"Quote":"The truth is that relative income is not directly related to happiness. Nonpartisan social-survey data clearly show that the big driver of happiness is earned success: a person's belief that he has created value in his life or the life of others."},{"Quote":"In 1977, when I became Speaker, I started meeting with TV reporters each morning when I arrived at work. Later in the morning, I would hold a news conference before the House opened.

The judgement of the intellect is only part of the truth."},{"Quote":"Quick condemnation of all that is not ours, of views with which we disagree, of ideas that do not attract us, is the sign of a narrow mind, of an uncultivated intelligence.
