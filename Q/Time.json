Some take us back, they're called memories. Some take us forward, they're called dreams."},{"Quote":"We live between the act of awakening and the act of surrender.

The young are slaves to dreams the old servants of regrets. Only the middle-aged have all their five senses in the keeping of their wits."},{"Quote":"The greatest achievement was at first and for a time a dream.

Just as in sleep our brains relax and give us dreams, so at some time in the day we need to disconnect, reconnect, and look around us."},{"Quote":"Divorce is a time of change.

Theirs was... a simpler time of contentment and patriotism."},{"Quote":"In my dreams, whatever I am doing, I look down to see if I have prosthetics. It sets my time frame in my dream, I think.

I have ridiculously large dreams, and half the time they come true."},{"Quote":"Although the events we appear to perceive in dreams are illusory, our feelings in response to dream content are real. Indeed, most of the events we experience in dreams are real; when we experience feelings, say, anxiety or ecstasy, in dreams, we really do feel anxious or ecstatic at the time."},{"Quote":"My life has been a continuous fulfillment of dreams. It appears that everything I saw and did has a new, and perhaps, more significant meaning, every time I see it. The earth is good.

I was not that kind of a writer. I was a rhymer. I was a fan of Dorothy Parker's, so maybe I wrote poetry to that extent, but my main focus was the humor of it, and word construction, and the slant.

All those things, I failed miserably at."},{"Quote":"We can't understand when we're pregnant, or when our siblings are expecting, how profound it is to have a shared history with a younger generation: blood, genes, humor.

I always love that kind of movie."},{"Quote":"Sad music, I always thought, is more beautiful than other music. But at the same time, I am in my personal life a very happy guy.

I can rehearse it. I can illustrate it with self-deprecating humor and humble-sounding personal disclosure. I can try to make it comes out just right."},{"Quote":"The real important things are kindness and a sense of humor. I've been fortunate to have dated and could have easily married women who have those qualities, and time and circumstances didn't work out. Timing plays a big part."},{"Quote":"Humor is very interesting to me. My films are not comedies, but there's comedy in them from time to time, absurdities, just like in real life."},{"Quote":"In high drama or high tragedy or anything, it's not really human unless there's some humor at the same time. And vice versa.

You gotta pass it on.'"},{"Quote":"You can't do anything to be funny. That's cringeworthy. If your humor comes out of a place of love every time, you don't make the joke bigger than you.

People who don't have a sense of humor must be so sad all the time."},{"Quote":"For the most part, comedians are pretty friendly with each other. They always say they badmouth each other, but most of the time, they're friends. We're the only ones that can really stand our type of humor."},{"Quote":"If you're playing a good guy, you show some darkness. If you're playing a dark guy, you show something different, like humor, that will mix it up and hopefully surpass the audience's expectations. What I'm battling all the time is complacency in the audience. I try to bring a little mystery to what might happen because that engages people more."},{"Quote":"There was a time I was very much blaming the way I felt on L.A, that it was a vacuum of creativity, of humor or anything organic, and I was really angry at the place. But then today I feel completely different - I love L.A.!"},{"Quote":"I think in my case, I had no choice but to have a good sense of humor.

Insult begets both rage and humor and often at the same time."},{"Quote":"Sometimes the only way to make palatable that which is appalling and apprehensive is to season it with some humor."},{"Quote":"Cathy was the first widely syndicated humor strip created by a woman. The strip was pretty revolutionary at the time not only because it starred a female, but also because it was so emotionally honest about all the conflicting feelings many women had in 1976."},{"Quote":"The humor is essentially dark for a cartoon and sophisticated. But at the same time, being a cartoon gives the writers more freedom than in a normal sitcom. It always pushes the line that, despite human failings, the Simpsons are really decent people."},{"Quote":"The script was just the best I'd read in a long time and I love the humor, which I wasn't expecting, and I like the fact that my six year old daughter can see the show without being, you know, protected from it."},{"Quote":"Putting a little time aside for clean fun and good humor is very necessary to relieve the tensions of our time."},{"Quote":"Sometimes in the most tragic situation, something just profoundly funny happens."},{"Quote":"I can't fall apart every time I mention that my mother's gone.

Of course, I don't overlook it and go straight for the humor, but I think we have to have humor to move forward."},{"Quote":"I like to think my sense of humor is sort of smart and dumb at the same time. I like to work on multiple levels - smart and dumb, funny and sad, profound and mundane, cynical and hopeful."},{"Quote":"So once I thought of the villain with a sense of humor, I began to think of a name and the name \"the Joker\" immediately came to mind.

America needs to get back to family values."},{"Quote":"We've seen over time that countries that have the best economic growth are those that have good governance, and good governance comes from freedom of communication. It comes from ending corruption. It comes from a populace that can go online and say, 'This politician is corrupt, this administrator, or this public official is corrupt.'"},{"Quote":"Technology is at the forefront of everything these days - communication, work. It's amazing and scary at the same time how robots have evolved, but I find it hard to believe that robots will completely rule the world.

Whereas when you're being interviewed, say, you have to talk on the fly, you have to improvise, you can change sentences around, and they're not exactly right."},{"Quote":"I think there's a fear of disconnect sometimes; communication is a huge issue for all of us, from adults to kids, as far as our face-to-face time and our ability to interact with each other without isolating itself to a phone. I think that has to be something that's very challenging."},{"Quote":"The way you build trust with your team is around super-clear communication in that instant when they say, 'I will be sad if you don't do X.' You have to say, 'We're not going to do X, and here's why, and believe me, you'll be much sadder later if I let you go do it and you spend a bunch of time on it and nothing ever happens.'"},{"Quote":"Perhaps because my relationship with my father went through such a long, bumpy time, it's been very important for me to work to try to keep lines of communication open between my sons and myself to try to avoid my father's mistakes. At least if you're making mistakes, make different mistakes."},{"Quote":"My stay-married secret would probably be exercising good communication, not when you have to but all the time. I think if you do that, you kinda just cleanse the situations, so there's not build up. I think that's probably the best way to do it."},{"Quote":"Without question, we need to be informed of the happenings in the world. But modern communication brings into our homes a drowning cascade of the violence and misery of the worldwide human race.

All email services, blogging services and social networks have to dedicate a significant amount of resources and time to fighting abuse and protecting their users."},{"Quote":"Around the time I began starving, in the early eighties, the visual image had begun to supplant text as culture's primary mode of communication, a radical change because images work so differently than words: They're immediate, they hit you at levels way beneath intellect, they come fast and furious."},{"Quote":"A painting has a lot of advantages over other forms of communication. Unlike a movie, you don't have to put it into a machine and turn it on. It's just there every day. It's not limited by the element of time.

I prefer face-to-face communication and sometimes Instagram."},{"Quote":"Sometimes there is a greater lack of communication in facile talking than in silence."},{"Quote":"At school I pretended I had a normal life, but I felt lonely all the time and different from everyone else.

I don't watch the news, I don't care about politics, I don't care about other sports. I don't care about anything I don't need to care about. This is my sport: it is my life.

Nothing else matters."},{"Quote":"We didn't lose the game we just ran out of time."},{"Quote":"I think that from the time you start playing sports as a child you see that your responsibility to your team is to play the best that you can play as an individual... and yet, not take anything away from being part of a team."},{"Quote":"All of my free time is made up of motor sports endeavors, be them motorcycles or off-road racing or track days.

It is so much fun being with them, as I'm enjoying every phase of motherhood."},{"Quote":"Compared to politics, I think sports is funnier, because it's inconsequential.

You know, some comedians can get this disease where they get serious all the time."},{"Quote":"Whatever free time I get, I love to catch news and sports shows."},{"Quote":"The idea of growing up in the South and being a man is an interesting thing; there's a lot masculinity involved, with hunting, fishing, and playing sports that rural people take pride in, but at the same time, I grew up really not wanting to hate anybody."},{"Quote":"It was easy being healthy when I was young. I was full of energy, so sports and physical challenges were fun. But as I got older and the spring left my step, exercise became harder, and eating, drinking and watching TV became easier.

I admired everything he did. He was a great sports person. He loved me. I was his only boy at that time, before my brother Billy came along."},{"Quote":"I played a lot of sports when I was a kid so I get in that ballgame mindset of being really, really respectful, but at same time saying to yourself, 'Don't back down a single inch, hang with these guys if you can.'

I just don't think they work in a team environment."},{"Quote":"He's going to be around a long, long time, if his body holds up.

I've also been able to coach all three of them in baseball and basketball, something that has strengthened our bonds and given me indescribable joy.

I saw time and again how much fun Africans had with their families and friends and on the sports fields; they laughed all the time."},{"Quote":"Perhaps the single most important element in mastering the techniques and tactics of racing is experience. But once you have the fundamentals, acquiring the experience is a matter of time."},{"Quote":"The reason swimming is one of the hardest sports is because you have to be in the pool by yourself every day, making that sacrifice. There's no time to do anything else."},{"Quote":"I didn't like books where people played on a sports team and won a bunch of games, or went to summer camp and had a wonderful time. I really liked a book where a witch might cut a child's head off or a pack of angry dogs might burst through a door and terrorize a family."},{"Quote":"I played a million different sports when I was growing up.

In fact, try as we may to make a silence, we cannot."},{"Quote":"The modern artist is working with space and time, and expressing his feelings rather than illustrating."},{"Quote":"Things are beautiful or ugly only in time and space. The new man's vision being liberated from these two factors, all is unified in one unique beauty."},{"Quote":"Sometimes siblings can get in each other's space."},{"Quote":"When time and space and change converge, we find place. We arrive in Place when we resolve things. Place is peace of mind and understanding. Place is knowledge of self. Place is resolution."},{"Quote":"When you get into your car, shut the door and be there for just half a minute. Breathe, feel the energy inside your body, look around at the sky, the trees. The mind might tell you, 'I don't have time.' But that's the mind talking to you. Even the busiest person has time for 30 seconds of space."},{"Quote":"Starbucks was founded around the experience and the environment of their stores.

They're not objects, they're not things, they go forever. Space and time are really tools of animal sense perception, the way we organize and construct information."},{"Quote":"You don't have to work for Google, or any of the other firms encouraging staff to pursue personal projects on company time, to use slowness to unlock your creativity. Anyone can do it. Start by clearing space in your schedule for rest, daydreaming and serendipity. Take breaks away from your desk, especially when you get stuck on a problem."},{"Quote":"Nearly everybody I know does something to try to remove herself to clear her head and to have enough time and space to think... All of us instinctively feel that something inside us is crying out for more spaciousness and stillness to offset the exhilarations of this movement and the fun and diversion of the modern world."},{"Quote":"The black holes of nature are the most perfect macroscopic objects there are in the universe: the only elements in their construction are our concepts of space and time."},{"Quote":"According to String Theory, what appears to be empty space is actually a tumultuous ocean of strings vibrating at the precise frequencies that create the 4 dimensions you and I call height, width, depth and time."},{"Quote":"Consciousness, rather than being an epiphenomenon of matter, is actually the source of matter.

You can just see it exactly as it was."},{"Quote":"The way I choose to live my own life rates time and space as real luxuries."},{"Quote":"Science sent the Hubble telescope out into space, so it could capture light and the absence thereof, from the very beginning of time.

These laws execute themselves. They are out of time, out of space, and not subject to circumstance."},{"Quote":"But a city is more than a place in space, it is a drama in time."},{"Quote":"I think the answer of course is that space and time are not these hard external objects. Again we're, scientists have been building from one side of nature (physics) without considering the other side (life in consciousness). Neither side exists without the other. They cannot be divorced from one another or else there is no reality."},{"Quote":"A monkey is unaware that atoms exist. Likewise, our brainpower may not stretch to the deepest aspects of reality. The bedrock nature of space and time, and the structure of our entire universe, may remain 'open frontiers' beyond human grasp."},{"Quote":"Painting is the most magical of mediums. The transcendence is truly amazing to me every time I go to a museum and I see how somebody figured another way to rub colored dirt on a flat surface and make space where there is no space or make you think of a life experience."},{"Quote":"The rhythm of relations of color and size makes the absolute appear in the relativity of time and space."},{"Quote":"When a place gets crowded enough to require ID's, social collapse is not far away.

The same thing happened with the invention of the printing press, the telegraph, and the radio."},{"Quote":"I tend to prioritize emotional realism above the known laws of time and space, and when you do that, it's inevitable that strange things happen. Which can be quite enjoyable, I think."},{"Quote":"Laughter is binary: It either happens or it doesn't.

We won the moon race; now it's time for us to live and work on Mars, first on its moons and then on its surface."},{"Quote":"I hate it when people slag us off. We had done three tours during 1970 and we finished off feeling we had just about had enough. We had done so much in that short space of time, we were drained."},{"Quote":"I loved climbing because of the freedom, and having time and space. I remember coming off Everest for the last time, thinking of Dad and wishing that he could have seen what I saw.

Many more lack access to a quality early childhood education that provides ample time and space to play."},{"Quote":"We have responsibilities for others, not just across space but across time. We have responsibilities to people who came before us. They left us a world of institutions, ideas or possibilities for which we, in turn, owe them something. One of the things we owe them is not to squander them."},{"Quote":"The urge to miniaturize electronics did not exist before the space program. I mean our grandparents had radios that was furniture in the living room. Nobody at the time was saying, 'Gee, I want to carry that in my pocket.' Which is a non-thought."},{"Quote":"What is wine? It is the grape present in another form; its essence is there, though the fruit which produced it grew thousands of miles away, and perished years ago. So the object of many a tender thought may be spiritually present, in defiance of space - and fond recollections cherished in defiance of time."},{"Quote":"Without consciousness, space and time are nothing."},{"Quote":"Relativity challenges your basic intuitions that you've built up from everyday experience. It says your experience of time is not what you think it is, that time is malleable. Your experience of space is not what you think it is; it can stretch and shrink."},{"Quote":"I always try to give my own albums space in between so I have time to create a new sound and give time for people to miss me. You have to come out fresh and reinvent yourself."},{"Quote":"Karma is only in space time and causality. Your real self resides non-locally."},{"Quote":"One has a responsibility to clean up one's space and make it livable as far as one's own resources go. That includes not only material resources, but psychological resources: the commitment of time and a portion of your mind to something when you'd rather be doing something else."},{"Quote":"The first time I drew a Superman story was 'For Tomorrow' with Brian Azzarello in 2004.

Sometimes, as with film, you can hybridize, but I think it's basically the space part of my brain wanting equal footing with the time part."},{"Quote":"It's time to open the space frontier to citizen explorers."},{"Quote":"There was a period of time during the 'Jagged Little Pill' era where I don't think I laughed for about two years. It was a survival mode, you know. It was an intense, constant, chronic over-stimulation and invasion of energetic and physical literal space."},{"Quote":"The wonderful thing about 48 fps is the integration of live action and CG elements; that is something I learned from 'The Hobbit.' We are so used to 24 fps and the romance of celluloid... but at 48 fps, you cannot deny the existence of these CG creations in the same time frame and space and environment as the live action."},{"Quote":"Work takes up a lot of my brain space. So when I work, it's one thing. I don't have a lot of time to think about dating."},{"Quote":"Every moment is as real as every other. Every 'now,' when you say, 'This is the real moment,' is as real as every other 'now' - and therefore all the moments are just out there. Just as every location in space is out there, I think every moment in time is out there, too."},{"Quote":"Black holes provide theoreticians with an important theoretical laboratory to test ideas. Conditions within a black hole are so extreme, that by analyzing aspects of black holes we see space and time in an exotic environment, one that has shed important, and sometimes perplexing, new light on their fundamental nature."},{"Quote":"There was a time when I was knocking on doors and concerned with being recognized in dominant culture. I've found a space where the terrain is different, where I'm embraced by people like me, and where I'm building new ways of doing things, as opposed to trying to insert myself in a place that might not be welcoming."},{"Quote":"We need to broaden our sympathies both in space and time - and perceive ourselves as part of a long heritage, and stewards for an immense future."},{"Quote":"The bedrock nature of space and time and the unification of cosmos and quantum are surely among science's great 'open frontiers.' These are parts of the intellectual map where we're still groping for the truth - where, in the fashion of ancient cartographers, we must still inscribe 'here be dragons.'"},{"Quote":"Weightlessness was unbelievable. It's physical euphoria: Nothing about you has any weight. You don't realize that you are weighed down all the time by yourself, and your organs, and your head. Your arms weigh down your shoulders. In space simulation, you get to fly like Superman! You're hanging in the air! It's the coolest thing."},{"Quote":"It says something very deep about humans and our society, something very good about us, that we've invested our time and treasure in building a machine that can fly across three billion miles of space to explore the Pluto system."},{"Quote":"Put two ships in the open sea, without wind or tide, and, at last, they will come together. Throw two planets into space, and they will fall one on the other. Place two enemies in the midst of a crowd, and they will inevitably meet; it is a fatality, a question of time; that is all."},{"Quote":"Flying in space is a privilege, whether it's the first time or the fourth time."},{"Quote":"Empty space is a boiling, bubbling brew of virtual particles that pop in and out of existence in a time scale so short that you can't even measure them."},{"Quote":"What was frustrating about Armageddon was the time I spent not doing anything. It was a big special effects film, and I wasn't crazy about pretending I was in outer space. It feels ridiculous."},{"Quote":"It is a matter of common knowledge among mystics that the evolutionary career of mankind is indissolubly bound up with the divine hierarchies, who rule the planets and the signs of the Zodiac, and that the passage of the Sun and the planets through the twelve signs of the Zodiac, marks man's progress in time and in space."},{"Quote":"A cigarette is a breathing space. It makes a parenthesis. The time of a cigarette is a parenthesis, and if it is shared, you are both in that parenthesis. It's like a proscenium arch for a dialogue."},{"Quote":"When you're an adult, when times are good, entire years go by in what feels like the space of one season. But the worst trick time plays on you is just how slowly the worst times in your life take you to live through."},{"Quote":"Time and space always change, but there is something which is eternal and changeless. For example, the world and time, past or future, nothing exists for us in sleep. But we exist. Let us try to find out that which is changeless and which always exists."},{"Quote":"Conjoined twins simply may not need sex-romance partners as much as the rest of us do. Throughout time and space, they have described their condition as something like being attached to a soul mate."},{"Quote":"Space is to place as eternity is to time."},{"Quote":"Reusable rockets promise much easier testing because you should usually get them back, and you can debug as you go rather than having to get everything perfect the first time."},{"Quote":"Lest those islands still seem to you too remote in space and time to be relevant to our modern societies, just think about the risks... of our increasing globalization and increasing worldwide economic interdependence."},{"Quote":"I used to think that the great thing about sculpture was that, like Stonehenge, it was something that stood against time in an adamantine way, and was an absolute mass in space. Now I try to use the language of architecture to redescribe the body as a place."},{"Quote":"By 1973, we had a space station, the Skylab, and we had multiple probes going up to planets. So, all this wonderful stuff happened in 10 to 15 years. About that time, there should have been enormous initiatives to make it affordable for people to fly in space, not just a handful of trained NASA astronauts and Russian cosmonauts."},{"Quote":"Back in the day, when I started, you were still allowed to make mistakes. You got to make your mistakes in public, in a way. I think the world was a more forgiving place when I started my career, in the sense that we got time and space to develop as a writer."},{"Quote":"The most amazing thing to me about the sea is the tide. A harbour like St. Ives is totally transformed in a very short space of time by the arrival or departure of the sea."},{"Quote":"It's such a long mission and we get to spend so much time in space... we're doing such exciting research. And I don't want to overemphasize the life science research, but as a physician the life science research that we're doing is extremely exciting."},{"Quote":"Each one of us decides to incarnate upon this planet at a particular point in time and space. We have chosen to come here to learn a particular lesson that will advance us upon our spiritual, evolutionary pathway."},{"Quote":"There is no time and space limitation for public accountability on the Internet. Creative commonality is standard and does not resemble the authoritarian style of the dead communist experience. It seems that it is no longer society's obligation to understand legislation it is a duty for governments to be understood by their people."},{"Quote":"Clearly, many branches of science need an exquisite precision of timekeeping and the infinitesimal decimals of calibration, so space launches, for example, are not scheduled for leap-second dates. But society as a whole neither needs that obsessive time measurement nor is well served by it."},{"Quote":"I was a frustrated astronaut all my life. I grew up at a time when space seemed to have no boundaries, and lots of us presumed humans would be living on the moon and landing on Mars."},{"Quote":"There are people who have too much space between their ears, and given the time, do nothing but free fall forever inside their head. It's a spooky thing to be left alone inside an angry inner-verse."},{"Quote":"When I'm auditioning for something, if it's not me, I really hope the part doesn't go to me. You know what I mean? I don't want to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. If it's me, wonderful. If it's not me, there's space for all of us."},{"Quote":"As a child, I spent a lot of time wandering around the prairies and in the hills, and there was a sense that it was such a wide-open space, and there was kind of a feeling of potential. I could imagine anything happening there."},{"Quote":"The ostensible subject of my photographs may be motion, but the subtext is time. A dancer's movements illustrate the passage of time, giving it a substance, materiality, and space. In my photographs, time is stopped, a split second becomes an eternity, and an ephemeral moment is solid as sculpture."},{"Quote":"I like the sci-fi channel. Just science in general. I came across a segment on time travel and how time travel is possible. We create a spaceship that's moving at almost the speed of light, we go in that spaceship in outer space, and we fly around for a year, when we get back to Earth, Earth would've aged 10 years."},{"Quote":"For a long time, we've worked on detecting planets with whatever was at hand, making use of existing small telescopes or even amateur telescopes. It's time to move on to the next stage."},{"Quote":"Space, time, matter, energy and biological life may be the result of a Source Field that is conscious and alive in its own unique way - on a scale far too vast for the finite mind to fathom."},{"Quote":"By the time we get to the 2040s, we'll be able to multiply human intelligence a billionfold. That will be a profound change that's singular in nature. Computers are going to keep getting smaller and smaller. Ultimately, they will go inside our bodies and brains and make us healthier, make us smarter."},{"Quote":"Computers are still technology because we are still wrestling with it: it's still being invented we're still trying to work out how it works. There's a world of game interaction to come that you or I wouldn't recognise. It's time for the machines to disappear. The computer's got to disappear into all of the things we use."},{"Quote":"No one ever said on their deathbed, 'Gee, I wish I had spent more time alone with my computer'."},{"Quote":"I think after a time there won't be anything left to be interesting for mankind. Computers are about to do everything for us. Cellphones are smarter than we are. We'll embrace spirituality because we'll be bored of everything else."},{"Quote":"I've always been into computers. When I was getting out of high school and forming my identity musically, all of it was really coming into the fold, computers and drum machines. It felt like, you know, I'm in the right place at the right time. I liked the collision."},{"Quote":"With all the abundance we have of computers and computing, what is scarce is human attention and time."},{"Quote":"Eventually, I believe, current attempts to understand the mind by analogy with man-made computers that can perform superbly some of the same external tasks as conscious beings will be recognized as a gigantic waste of time."},{"Quote":"There's so much free material on the Internet you can learn from, and some people are pure self-starters: they pick up computers and teach themselves everything. Certainly there are millions of people like that. But at the same time, I think it's a pretty small percentage of the population."},{"Quote":"Computers may save time but they sure waste a lot of paper. About 98 percent of everything printed out by a computer is garbage that no one ever reads."},{"Quote":"I get hired to hack into computers now and sometimes it's actually easier than it was years ago."},{"Quote":"Originally, I was in both software and in online computing. The first innovation really was sort of at that time that we're marrying the telephone and the computer so that people wouldn't have to drive to the computer center. We didn't have $1,000 computers."},{"Quote":"One of the big first computers was called SAGE, which was a missile defense, the first missile-defense computer, which was, like, one of the first computers in the history of the world which got sold to the Department of Defense for, I don't know, tens and tens of millions of dollars at the time."},{"Quote":"I just think people have a lot of fiction. But, you know, I mean, the real story of Facebook is just that we've worked so hard for all this time. I mean, the real story is actually probably pretty boring, right?

I mean, the real story is actually probably pretty boring, right? I mean, we just sat at our computers for six years and coded."},{"Quote":"Our computers double in capability on time scales of only a few years. It's hardly outrageous to believe that we will successfully develop thinking machines within a handful of decades, or at most a century or two. If that happens, these artificial sentients will quickly leave us behind."},{"Quote":"Given the volume of PC sales and the way McAfee runs its operation, I imagine there must be thousands of phantom subscribers - folks who signed up once upon a time and left the software behind two or three computers ago."},{"Quote":"The reason why Apple computers have worked so well over time is that, unlike Microsoft, they don't bend over backward to be compatible with every piece of hardware or software in the digital universe. To code or create for Apple, you follow Apple's rules. If you're even allowed to."},{"Quote":"I have a crazy amount of different jobs, so the way I manage that is to not do more than one at a time. It's like old computers that had small memory chips, they would do something called swapping, where they would fill the memory with one task, do it and get it out."},{"Quote":"India for sure is a mobile-first country. But I don't think it will be a mobile-only country for all time. An emerging market will have more computing in their lives, not less computing, as there is more GDP and there is more need. As they grow, they will also want computers that grow from their phone."},{"Quote":"I'm projecting somewhere between 100 million and 200 million computers on the Net by the end of December 2000, and about 300 million users by that same time."},{"Quote":"The whole hardware industry has experienced the phenomenon in which every time computers get cheaper, they appeal to a new set of users; every time they get more powerful, old customers upgrade."},{"Quote":"The way we live is changing. Each year, our free time shrinks a little more as computers clamor for an increasing percentage of our attention."},{"Quote":"Computers shouldn't be parents, but they are. Please, spend time with your kids. If you don't want to, then I don't want to. It might hurt you to discipline your offspring, but it saves the child from being disciplined later by someone less forgiving. Like a criminal court judge. If you don't spank your child, someone else will."},{"Quote":"I am not one of the new media experts working all the time with my computers and the PowerPoints and things of that sort."},{"Quote":"This is a man who was 23 years old when he theorized the idea of creating a programmable machine, and in that way, Turing foresaw computers and artificial intelligence. These were revolutionary ideas at that time."},{"Quote":"There are more clocks than ever - clocks on computers, on cell phones, on televisions, on any screen available, telling time to the digital second - but they all seem to matter less."},{"Quote":"The ownership of computers in the home is far less than the statistics show, because usually when the computer breaks down once, that is the end of it for a long, long time. They do not have the money or incentive to get the computer repaired."},{"Quote":"We think we're saving time with microwaves, cell phones, beepers, computers and voice mail, but often these things help us create the illusion of getting somewhere - and they foster a chain of constant activity. We're really just squeezing extra activity into every minute that we gain."},{"Quote":"By the time I was a senior in high school, I knew I wanted to move to Silicon Valley and learn more about computers and the Internet. I just fell in love with technology and the potential of everything the Internet had to offer."},{"Quote":"I don't take for granted all the blessings that I have, and as soon as I heard about Computers for Youth, I really wanted to be involved. Anyone who knows me knows how much time I spend on computers. I'm a computer addict. Every young person deserves to have a computer in his or her home."},{"Quote":"I grew up around electronic instruments. To me, the turntable is an electronic device. At the same time, I had access to drum machines and keyboards through my uncle; then track recorders into computers. At an early age, I was messing with computers more than most hip-hop musicians."},{"Quote":"One of the things that is not so good is that a decision was made long ago about the size of an IP address - 32 bits. At the time it was a number much larger than anyone could imagine ever having that many computers but it turned out to be to small."},{"Quote":"As a kid, I was always into art at the same time as computers, and eventually I realised I was making more interesting stuff with my keyboard than with my hands. I really enjoyed modifying computer games more than playing them, so that got me into programming."},{"Quote":"When computers came along, I felt for the first time that I had the proper tools for the kind of theoretical work I wanted to do. So I moved over to that, and that got me into psychology."},{"Quote":"Our lives sometimes depend on computers performing as predicted."},{"Quote":"And it's here and it's ready and we can really revolutionize the way we educate our children with tablet computers, and I'm committed to doing whatever I can to speaking to whomever I can to send this signal - to pound this message home. Now is the time."},{"Quote":"I happen to think that computers are the most important thing to happen to musicians since the invention of cat-gut which was a long time ago."},{"Quote":"I'm always working. I don't really set limits. I tend to go in bursts. And in between, I'm doing my taxes, answering the phone, and all those kinds of things. I waste a lot of time. Computers take a lot of time. I love computers."},{"Quote":"Failure's inevitable. It happens all the time in a complex economy. And how did the economy produce all these amazing things that we have around us, computers and cell phones and so on? Well, the process was trial and error. There were a bunch of ideas, and the good ones grew and prospered, and the bad ones were pretty ruthlessly weeded out."},{"Quote":"I watch virtually no TV. All my screen time is computer time for me. When I'm not doing that I'm reading or talking to my friends who I got to know through computers."},{"Quote":"I joined the staff of EMI in Middlesex in 1951, where I worked for a while on radar and guided weapons and later ran a small design laboratory. During this time, I became particularly interested in computers, which were then in their infancy. It was interesting, pioneering work at that time: drums and tape decks had to be designed from scratch."},{"Quote":"Imagine if every Thursday your shoes exploded if you tied them the usual way. This happens to us all the time with computers, and nobody thinks of complaining."},{"Quote":"I think I was lucky to come of age in a place and time - the American South in the 1960s and '70s - when the machine hadn't completely taken over life. The natural world was still the world, and machines - TV, telephone, cars - were still more or less ancillary, and computers were unheard of in everyday life."},{"Quote":"The time is always right to do what is right."},{"Quote":"Rough diamonds may sometimes be mistaken for worthless pebbles."},{"Quote":"Truth has no special time of its own. Its hour is now - always."},{"Quote":"Genius is never understood in its own time."},{"Quote":"And know that I am with you always; yes, to the end of time."},{"Quote":"Christmas is the spirit of giving without a thought of getting. It is happiness because we see joy in people. It is forgetting self and finding time for others. It is discarding the meaningless and stressing the true values."},{"Quote":"Halloween isn't the only time for ghosts and ghost stories. In Victorian Britain, spooky winter's tales were part of the Christmas season, often told after dinner, over port or coffee."},{"Quote":"I started making music... I guess I was 12, and I started playing 'Guitar Hero.' And you know, it got to a point where on expert, you can only exceed to a certain point. And so, you know, I was like, 'Let's play real guitar. Let's not waste more time.' So, I got my mom, I told her to buy me a guitar for Christmas, and I started making music then."},{"Quote":"My parents were kind of over protective people. Me and my sister had to play in the backyard all the time. They bought us bikes for Christmas but wouldn't let us ride in the street, we had to ride in the backyard. Another Christmas, my dad got me a basketball hoop and put it in the middle of the lawn! You can't dribble on grass."},{"Quote":"Christmas is the day that holds all time together."},{"Quote":"Christmas and the holidays are the season of giving. It's a time when people are more kind and open-hearted."},{"Quote":"I had eight brothers and sisters. Every Christmas my younger brother Bobby would wake up extra early and open everybody's presents - everybody's - so by the time the rest of us got up, all the gifts were shredded, ribbons off, torn open and thrown aside."},{"Quote":"Every product you have ever loved was a compromise from the ideal vision of its creators to the realities of shipping on time, on budget, and on price point. Anyone who has ever manufactured a physical product that had to be on the shelves for Christmas shopping knows how painful these choices can be."},{"Quote":"I love spending time with my family and friends during the holidays, and my favorite holiday tradition would be the pozole that my mom makes almost every Christmas. It's the best!"},{"Quote":"Our many different cultures notwithstanding, there's something about the holidays that makes the planet communal. Even nations that do not celebrate Christmas can't help but be caught up in the collective spirit of their neighbors, as twinkling lights dot the landscape and carols fill the air. It's an inspiring time of the year."},{"Quote":"Once again, we come to the Holiday Season, a deeply religious time that each of us observes, in his own way, by going to the mall of his choice."},{"Quote":"Isn't that the great thing about Christmas?

But for others, service will come first."},{"Quote":"Back in 1960 at Christmas time, I did work loading and unloading boxcars for Railway Express. That was a kind of weight training that helped me.

And it's hard to have a Christmas without seeing a little bit of Jimmy Stewart and angels running around town."},{"Quote":"My family background is Mexican, and I was born in Chicago. It's pretty much family tradition every time we get together for Christmas and major holidays to sing.

Christmas was always one of the biggest celebrations in Sweden, and I look forward to the festivities each year."},{"Quote":"I don't have a real recipe with measurements for my chicken stew. I just kind of make it up as I go. I made it for the first time one Christmas when I came home from college. It's guaranteed to cure a cold."},{"Quote":"Christmas means a great deal to me.

At 18, I told myself if I don't live in the woods by myself by the time I'm 25, I have failed."},{"Quote":"I still have the Triumph Palm Beach I was given for Christmas when I was 11.

The period from mid-October to Christmas, for instance, is 'ghost story' time, while Jane Austen and P. G. Wodehouse pretty much own April and May."},{"Quote":"Comparing 'Christmas Vacation' to 'It's A Wonderful Life' is the silliest thing.

I had such an awful time in my own teen years - I love having the chance to relive them through my fiction."},{"Quote":"It seems like whenever a big newspaper or TV show talks about teen literature, they focus on dark books or vampire books.

Luckily, my family and friends were very supportive and were there for me every step of the way."},{"Quote":"I grew up in a small town in Kansas, so I love meeting the fans. Those are the people who spend time out of their day to watch the things that I've done, and I've gotten to do some great supernatural stuff - 'Teen Wolf' and 'The Gates' before that - so it's nice when I get to go to Comic-Con every year."},{"Quote":"I pass on a lot of teen roles that get sent to me because a lot of the time it doesn't feel real. It's sugar-coated. There's no depth to it."},{"Quote":"When I was a freshman, I didn't have that much time for extra-curriculars, so I didn't do any theater stuff. Actually, I didn't do it with my school. I did theater with this thing called Teen Source."},{"Quote":"Some people ask the secret of our long marriage. We take time to go to a restaurant two times a week. A little candlelight, dinner, soft music and dancing. She goes Tuesdays, I go Fridays."},{"Quote":"I was raised in a very humble environment, and I was always taught to be humble to the things that are happening in my life because they're blessings.

There are so many actors who have come out with albums these days. I don't want to do it because it's the thing to do. I want to wait until the time is right."},{"Quote":"People speculate on your personal life all the time anyway. So I just think it's important to keep my private life private and my public persona more into music, you know?"},{"Quote":"Oratory is the masterful art. Poetry, painting, music, sculpture, architecture please, thrill, inspire - but oratory rules. The orator dominates those who hear him, convinces their reason, controls their judgment, compels their action.

I still do. I send him my demos all the time."},{"Quote":"I used to do crazy things that people would bail me out of, and I'm just grateful that I survived.

The fans really wanted me to go back on stage and do the Supremes music, so I went about trying to make it happen. We'll go on tour in the summer."},{"Quote":"But with rap music - not just N.W.A. - but rap music in general, seeing these artists wearing these team logos all the time started bringing a synergy and energy about having to rep your city, your team, everywhere and all the time."},{"Quote":"Ironically, being a coach on 'The Voice' and spending time with those kids, Xenia and Dia especially, I learned a lot about myself.

I work with men 98 percent of the time - producers, arrangers, musicians, engineers."},{"Quote":"I always tell the fans, 'Screw it! Like what you like. Listen to what you want.'

Before they know it, time runs out."},{"Quote":"I believe music should reflect yourself in some way and not just yourself at the given time. I feel that when you die or when you're going, someone's supposed to listen to that music and know everything about you.

Although the music is quite good the direction was like a box of fireworks that caught light all at the same time."},{"Quote":"It's about giving the people what they want. So many people have told me that they've made love to my records so what I've delivered this time is an album about sex. Pretty much every song has that theme.

Not to say that it is not important to listen to guitar players, but there's so much music out there and so many possibilities. I like anyone who plays any instrument."},{"Quote":"Let us never know what old age is. Let us know the happiness time brings, not count the years."},{"Quote":"Every great architect is - necessarily - a great poet. He must be a great original interpreter of his time, his day, his age."},{"Quote":"I'm glad I was born when I was. My time was the golden age of variety. If I were starting out again now, maybe things would happen for me, but it certainly would not be on a variety show with 28 musicians, 12 dancers, two major guest stars, 50 costumes a week by Bob Mackie.

You know, I hear all this crap about, 'Oh, you can age with dignity.' Really?"},{"Quote":"Youth is the spirit of adventure and awakening.

Each time the lessons are studied comes some new meaning, some new thought which will make us better."},{"Quote":"I feel like every time I write a song, it feels like the first time I wrote a song.

My wife is Jewish. And I'm fine with my son being raised as a Jew. He's learning Hebrew and is really into it. I will talk to my own son about my atheism when the time is right.

Then I moved to L.A., and if you're not known, it's hard to get stage time. So you start out doing what they call 'bringers' - you have to bring five people if you wanna get on stage. It was a lot of hustle, a learning curve."},{"Quote":"Each time you go to the grocery store with your kids, it is a potential learning opportunity.

What are we empathizing to?'"},{"Quote":"I love cookbooks for completely different reasons. I love 'The Harry's Bar Cookbook' and Marco-Pierre White's 'White Heat' for their feel.

The first lesson a chef needs to learn is how to handle a knife; the second is how to be around all that food."},{"Quote":"I'm Italian. I love to cook Italian food, so I learned from my dad how to make sauce and meatballs and all that stuff. With my wife and kids, I started making homemade pasta.

The commitment to give of yourself and the knowledge that the time is right are what's important."},{"Quote":"I am afraid of aeroplanes. I've been able to avoid flying for some time, but I suppose, if I had to, I would. Perhaps it's a case of a little knowledge being a dangerous thing. At one time, I had a pilot's licence and 160 hours of solo time on single-engine light aircraft. Unfortunately, all that seemed to do was make me mistrust large aeroplanes."},{"Quote":"I think that probably the most important thing about our education was that it taught us to question even those things we thought we knew.

If you spend that much time thinking about your own clothes, you're not spending enough time thinking about what you're designing."},{"Quote":"I spent a lot of time in the White House in the public areas where reporters are allowed to go, but I spoke to people about the private quarters as well.

And that they're always part of the show. Phish concerts are a communal experience."},{"Quote":"I think experience will teach you a combination of liberalism and conservatism. We have to be progressive and at the same time we have to retain values. We have to hold onto the past as we explore the future."},{"Quote":"My mother always read to me as a child.

Every player must go through that, but when the federation hired me, they told me they wanted new players and young players who will prepare for the future."},{"Quote":"As with real reading, the ability to comprehend subtlety and complexity comes only with time and a lot of experience. If you don't adequately acquire those skills, moving out into the real world of real people can actually become quite scary."},{"Quote":"We want people to experience art and think about it. The art reflects our time, it is about our culture."},{"Quote":"I think about things like the fact that nobody knows what time is. Time is what?

The scenes that I was in, Brooke really directed me all the time. And the scenes that both of us were in, Brooke directed those.

You have a better picture of the world. The diversity of thought is where you can make better business decisions."},{"Quote":"Across Africa there is what I call a colonialist mentality or orthodoxy. Orthodoxy in the sense that a lot of things have gone wrong in Africa in the post-colonial period. And time and time again, any time something went wrong, the leadership claims that it was never their fault."},{"Quote":"The bottom line is, I hear my donors, I hear our base out there, I hear the leadership.

I do like routines. I always travel with someone. My life in Avignon is a very quiet one. I have an apartment that looks over the whole city. I can drop into town, but a lot of the time I write from home. In some respects I still live a very quiet, simple life."},{"Quote":"With all the stuff that's going on in the world - after I watch the news, read the news, and listen to my podcasts, at the end of the day, am I really going to watch an episode of murder and time travel?"},{"Quote":"For years, I had no time for exploratory travel."},{"Quote":"I am always exhausted; I am always trying to find more time to be with my family, which is why they travel with me so much."},{"Quote":"I've always been into visual effects. It was something I took keen interest in before films happened. Ironically, I am a part of 'Raaz 3,' a film that is shot entirely on 3D. It has encouraged me to pursue my dream. Hopefully, if time permits, I will travel to the United States and attend a crash course in visual graphics and animation."},{"Quote":"Every time I took a long leave from home, I felt as if I were going to conquer the world. Or rather, take possession of what is my birthright, my inheritance."},{"Quote":"Every day is intense and alive, whether it's travel, work, even down time, which there is so little of."},{"Quote":"The only thing I like about air travel is it gives me time to read."},{"Quote":"I wanted to do my part to help preserve that golden age of travel... I step aboard The Patron Tequila Express railcar, and I go back in time to the days when a long journey was something fun and very special."},{"Quote":"I mean, the first 'Back to the Future' is kind of a perfect script, I think, in terms of handling time travel the best. It depends on your definition. To me, that means it effectively uses it in the story."},{"Quote":"The time to enjoy a European trip is about three weeks after unpacking."},{"Quote":"I myself believe that there will one day be time travel because when we find that something isn't forbidden by the over-arching laws of physics we usually eventually find a technological way of doing it."},{"Quote":"Since traveling is such a big part of my life when I am working, I like to vacation relatively close to home. Florida is a great place for me to go and relax. It's so close, which is perfect because it's the minimal travel time."},{"Quote":"This circus that's advertised to show and furnish a little amusement for us heathens is owned by a woman, one whose pluck catches my sympathy every time."},{"Quote":"With a film, you just don't have time to build sympathy for the character.

Both people deserve it."},{"Quote":"I think we lost a great deal of sympathy and support with the way in which the crisis was handled, most importantly I think when we appeared to be grasping for too much at one time instead of identifying our priorities in a much more responsible fashion."},{"Quote":"The professional must learn to be moved and touched emotionally, yet at the same time stand back objectively: I've seen a lot of damage done by tea and sympathy."},{"Quote":"Thanksgiving is America's favorite holiday because it's a time when we put aside our cares, much as the struggling Pilgrims did nearly four centuries ago, and eat a gut-busting meal without worrying about the 'out years.'"},{"Quote":"When people come to my act any time after Thanksgiving, I usually say, You shouldn't be here. You should be shopping. Our economy depends on you! You should be out there buying stuff.'"},{"Quote":"There was a time, in the not so distant past, that if you didn't have what you needed on Thanksgiving, you were pretty much going to have to wait until Friday. Not anymore!"},{"Quote":"As much as I love crisp, clean whites, there's always a time for rich but balanced Chardonnays with oak, especially at Thanksgiving."},{"Quote":"I loved my mom so much because she had to work on a penny just to put food on the table...

My feeling is, if I can't figure out how to make money the rest of the year so that my workers can enjoy the holidays, then I don't deserve to be an owner."},{"Quote":"You're going to go through tough times - that's life. But I say, 'Nothing happens to you, it happens for you.' See the positive in negative events."},{"Quote":"Dedicating some time to meditation is a meaningful expression of caring for yourself that can help you move through the mire of feeling unworthy of recovery. As your mind grows quieter and more spacious, you can begin to see self-defeating thought patterns for what they are, and open up to other, more positive options."},{"Quote":"There's sadness to anyone that dies before their time, and specifically ones that seem to affect people in a positive way. It doesn't matter if it's Whitney Houston or a nameless, faceless person on the street.

If you log all the time with negativity in the while world, I wonder how much better the world would be if people sat down and did something positive. It spirals."},{"Quote":"All personality traits have their good side and their bad side. But for a long time, we've seen introversion only through its negative side and extroversion mostly through its positive side."},{"Quote":"You hear certain things, negative things, all the time that aren't true, but you never hear about the positive."},{"Quote":"If we just wanted positive emotions, our species would have died out a long time ago."},{"Quote":"I'm one of five sisters. I'm the younger of twins, and we're the youngest of five girls, and we've always been very close. We were pretty much a gang. I take after my mother a lot in terms of personality and character. She was very positive; always looked on the bright side of things. She had a tough time of it with my dad but did her best."},{"Quote":"An investigator starts research in a new field with faith, a foggy idea, and a few wild experiments. Eventually the interplay of negative and positive results guides the work. By the time the research is completed, he or she knows how it should have been started and conducted."},{"Quote":"Positive, healthy, loving relationships in your twenties... I don't know if anyone would disagree with it: I think they're the exception, not the norm.

So I spend a lot of time on airplanes with other people and in terminals or just traveling around and going to restaurants or whatever. The interaction I get on a daily basis is always positive. I've never had a negative interaction."},{"Quote":"All I would say is that when I've been very down or having kind of a tough time in my life, certain films or pieces of music or books have changed that. They've taken me out of a dark place and put me into a more positive one. And I think that if we can do that for people, then it's certainly worth doing."},{"Quote":"I'm a person who watches TV all the time - all the time I love TV.

I consider 'confused' the majority position because, thankfully, most people would rather be uncertain some of the time than 100% positive all the time - even when they're wrong."},{"Quote":"In nicey-nicey land, you must be happy-clappy and positive all the time - bad news is taboo."},{"Quote":"The positive news is that the British economy is continuing to grow and is creating jobs. And it is positive news too that at a time of real international instability we are a safe haven in the storm."},{"Quote":"You know, the standard state for people is 'mildly pleasant.' Negative emotions are quite rare, and extremely positive emotions are rare.

Whether you're handing it off or throwing to somebody, I think that's extremely important."},{"Quote":"You don't have to be positive all the time."},{"Quote":"Saudi Arabia isn't the enemy, but it is a problem. It could make so much positive difference in the Islamic world if it used its status to soothe Sunni-Shiite tensions and encourage tolerance. For a time, under King Abdullah, it seemed that the country was trying to reform, but now under King Salman, it has stalled."},{"Quote":"If you look at the history of technology over a couple hundred years, it's all about time compression and making the globe smaller. It's had positive effects, all the ones that we know. So we're much less likely to have the kind of terrible misunderstandings that led to World War I, for example."},{"Quote":"There's a certain darkness to Slipknot, but at the same time, there's a very strong dose of positivity. Stone Sour is the same way. There's a certain melancholy that comes with the slower stuff, but at the end of the day there's also that other side that is very positive. It's all how you deliver."},{"Quote":"I don't want to waste anyone's time or money. I want to give people some truth and positive heart lift."},{"Quote":"There is slow growth, but it is positive slow growth. At the same time, ratios of debt-to-incomes go down.

If you're negative, you'll find yourself surrounded by negative people."},{"Quote":"I think positive. I always think we're going to score. Two minutes is a lot of time if you have timeouts and you're throwing every down. You have to make the right decisions. I've always had great receivers, which helps. It's not just me doing it."},{"Quote":"I realize myself that hate wastes a lot of time and energy and I would rather re-direct any energy that I have to good and positive use."},{"Quote":"I find the positive in the negative all the time. Any time you give something power, it wins, and it can continuously happen, so I just let negative people know they have no place in my life. They have no place around my children."},{"Quote":"I don't pay attention to the number of birthdays. It's weird when I say I'm 53. It just is crazy that I'm 53. I think I'm very immature.

I thought, if really want to write, it's time to start. I picked up the book How to Write a Novel in 90 Days. The author said to just write three pages a day, and I figured, I can do this. I never got past Page 3 of that book."},{"Quote":"When I was six, my best friend's parents bought him a piano. My mother noticed that every time I would go to his house, the first thing I would say to him was 'Levester' - His name was Levester - I said, 'Levester, can I go play your piano?' So, on my 7th birthday, my parents bought me a piano."},{"Quote":"I wrote 'The Room', 'The Birthday Party', and 'The Dumb Waiter' in 1957, I was acting all the time in a repertory company, doing all kinds of jobs, traveling to Bournemouth and Torquay and Birmingham."},{"Quote":"It's odd the things that people remember.

Any time someone has a birthday, I make them a really special cake that they all seem to love - it's a Coca-Cola cake."},{"Quote":"The first time I went on a serious run was when I was 21 years old at Stanford University. From 21 to 30, I continued the tradition and ran 10 miles every year on my birthday."},{"Quote":"I was only 16 when I was selected for 'Madrasapattinam.' I celebrated my 17th birthday on the set of the film. That was the first time I had travelled to India, and it was a rollercoaster ride. I soon fell in love with the country."},{"Quote":"I grew up doing all that stuff because I was obsessed with the '50s. I had sock hops for birthday parties. So I've always done The Twist and stuff. It was pretty natural and, with my parents doing it all the time, I'd just copy them. Not very pretty."},{"Quote":"I timed my previous wife's pregnancy to the moment to have my son born on Bob Dylan's 50th birthday. There is no bigger Bob Dylan fan than me. You don't just time the day and impregnate your wife to get your kid to be born on Bob Dylan's 50th birthday."},{"Quote":"That's the great thing about New Year's, you get to be a year older.

And then he came to a show of mine and we spoke back stage. The third time was at Brian Wilson's birthday party."},{"Quote":"Jewellery's not a big thing for me.

You can't live like a kid forever, you know?"},{"Quote":"My favorite movies are the ones that are different the second time, or where you're constantly discovering new things.

I think movies should illuminate new stories."},{"Quote":"Whenever I think about movies, I always look at that art process as having the best of a lot of worlds.

Every now and then, you crash and burn, but that's part of it."},{"Quote":"If you look at Indian movies, every time they wanted an exotic locale, they would have a dance number in Kashmir. Kashmir was India's fairyland. Indians went there because in a hot country you go to a cold place. People would be entranced by the sight of snow."},{"Quote":"So many things have to come together to get a creatively successful and financially successful film. Sometimes you'll have a movie that you're very proud of, and you think it transcended all of your expectations, but it doesn't come out at the right time.

Of course, as a mother who has to watch so many movies, you really appreciate it when somebody makes a film that is for everybody - family entertainment that's really for the family, where everyone has a good time."},{"Quote":"I am a cynical optimist. Big opening weekends are like cotton candy. The films you will remember over time are the films that stick in the consciousness of the audience in a good way."},{"Quote":"'Spider-Man' seems to have a different tone to the pure Marvel stuff, but I really enjoyed the 'Guardians Of The Galaxy' and 'Iron Man' movies. I love the special effects and how it seems very real, but at the same time, it still lives within the realm of Marvel.

My mother liked old movies, and she loved shopping for antiques, so I was around old things all the time."},{"Quote":"I think 'North by Northwest' and 'Rope' and Rear Window' and 'Psycho' are on my list of favorite all time movies. I just think his kind of command as a director was almost unparalleled, and I feel like in certain ways the sort of character-based thriller owes more to Hitchcock than anyone."},{"Quote":"I love to hang out with my friends and go to the movies. My mom and I are involved in the Mother/Daughter Organization - national charity work. Whenever I get free time, we volunteer.

My time to enjoy myself away from movies."},{"Quote":"I've been around a long time, and when I was at the top of the hill, I was very ahead of my time! Evidence of that is that my music is still current today - you know, rappers sample it all the time. So, rather than compromise my artistic integrity, I concentrated on movies."},{"Quote":"You just realize that at the beginning of 'Scooby' you're just going to start at level ten and stay at ten the entire time. It's hard. It physically beats you up. It's definitely one of the hardest movies you can do."},{"Quote":"I grew up with two sisters, and we owned three movies: 'Grease,' 'It's a Wonderful Life,' and 'Grease 2.' And you can only watch 'Wonderful Life' in the last half of the year. So I don't remember a time when I didn't know 'Grease.'"},{"Quote":"Every time I make a picture the critics' estimate of American public taste goes down ten percent."},{"Quote":"Cult movies are basically movies Hollywood missed the first time - that they should have gotten - and then the fans got it and made it successful."},{"Quote":"I learned at a very early age that life is a battle. My family was poor, my neighborhood was poor. The only way that I could get away from the awfulness of life, at that time, was at the movies. There I decided that my big aim was to make money. And it was there that I became a very determined woman."},{"Quote":"We live in a time of conflict - external and internal - when we sometimes concentrate too much on what divides us. Today, fly the Stars and Stripes with pride and confidence that what unites is far stronger."},{"Quote":"The music industry's actions at the time of 9/11 and since have been actions driven by patriotism in most instances, and greed and stupidity to a lesser degree. Sounds like real life doesn't it?"},{"Quote":"The most tragic paradox of our time is to be found in the failure of nation-states to recognize the imperatives of internationalism."},{"Quote":"Growing up in New York with artist parents - a very liberal environment, where we were always encouraged to challenge the status quo - I think for a long time I confused jingoism with patriotism. And that is a mistake."},{"Quote":"I hate patriotism... I can't stand it. It's a round world last time I checked."},{"Quote":"We are a big country, with lots of advantages and history. We are proud to be French. We have to call on patriotism at this time... to ask for an effort in the battle against debt."},{"Quote":"When I was a kid, back in the '40s, I was a voracious comic book reader. And at that time, there was a lot of patriotism in the comics. They were called things like 'All-American Comics' or 'Star-Spangled Comics' or things like that. I decided to do a logo that was a parody of those comics, with 'American' as the first word."},{"Quote":"In 'The King's Speech,' patriotism is utterly contained within a historical moment, the third of September, 1939, where the aggressor is clear, the fight is clear, it hasn't become complicated over time."},{"Quote":"They are patriotic in time of war because it is to their interest to be so, but in time of peace they follow power and the dollar wherever they may lead."},{"Quote":"America beats on you so hard the whole time. You are constantly being pummeled by other people's rights and their sense of patriotism."},{"Quote":"The proper means of increasing the love we bear our native country is to reside some time in a foreign one."},{"Quote":"I think you need to go through some stuff to really appreciate life and understand what it means to persevere, overcome and have faith. I think those tough times make you a stronger person."},{"Quote":"It is never too late to strengthen the foundation of faith. There is always time. With faith in the Savior, you can repent and plead for forgiveness. There is someone you can forgive. There is someone you can thank. There is someone you can serve and lift. You can do it wherever you are and however alone and deserted you may feel."},{"Quote":"Your heart has to be prepared ahead of time through faith and prayer and grace and mercy and love and forgiveness so you can keep your heart open in hell, when hell happens."},{"Quote":"Let us be sure that those who come after will say of us in our time, that in our time we did everything that could be done. We finished the race; we kept them free; we kept the faith."},{"Quote":"Sometimes all you need is a big leap of faith."},{"Quote":"I spend a lot of time balancing between faith and disbelief."},{"Quote":"Faith and doubt cannot exist in the same mind at the same time, for one will dispel the other."},{"Quote":"There's stuff going on in the world right now, which you can't imagine why is this happening; it's crazy. I don't know what the answer is, but if you didn't have faith in the universe that somehow something great would arrive at the end, then we'd all give up, and that would be a waste of everyone's time."},{"Quote":"When our forefathers put down roots in desolate places, the thing that allowed them to survive was that they had a faith to see them through the tough times."},{"Quote":"I have kept a steady focus on restoring public faith in our state government since taking office July 1. Now it is time to make even bigger and bolder gains through legislative action."},{"Quote":"I don't have faith in young people any more. I don't waste time trying to communicate with them."},{"Quote":"I'm always fascinated when people really fervently believe, because I have such a hard time believing anything. When people have real faith in something, it's fascinating to me. And the fact that so many people, in surveys, so many people say they do. It kind of blows my mind."},{"Quote":"'Grace' is basically a death prayer. Not something of sorrow, but of just casting away any fear of death. No relief will come - you really just have to stew in your life until it's time to go. But sometimes, somebody else's faith in you can do wonders."},{"Quote":"To insure the adoration of a theorem for any length of time, faith is not enough, a police force is needed as well."},{"Quote":"Each party steals so many articles of faith from the other, and the candidates spend so much time making each other's speeches, that by the time election day is past there is nothing much to do save turn the sitting rascals out and let a new gang in."},{"Quote":"Nothing guarantees that reasonable people will agree about everything, of course, but the unreasonable are certain to be divided by their dogmas. It is time we recognized that this spirit of mutual inquiry, which is the foundation of all real science, is the very antithesis of religious faith."},{"Quote":"Theatre's great. It's such an act of faith. It's a wonderful art form where you suspend disbelief for a couple of hours. It's a lovely art form because the actors and the audience are alive and in the room at the same time together. That's why I love the theatre."},{"Quote":"You have got to believe in yourself every time you go out there and race. If you have no faith in your ability all that training has been a waste of time."},{"Quote":"The issue of equal rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals has vexed politicians for decades. I have my own cloudy history with the issue, having supported a law in Mississippi that made it illegal for LGBT couples to adopt children. I believed at the time this was a principled position based on my faith."},{"Quote":"Man is wise and constantly in quest of more wisdom; but the ultimate wisdom, which deals with beginnings, remains locked in a seed. There it lies, the simplest fact of the universe and at the same time the one which calls forth faith rather than reason."},{"Quote":"Integrating breakthrough technology into everyday products is always a challenge; at the same time, this is exactly how design makes tech products easily adoptable in life."},{"Quote":"In just six weeks from the time the design was started, we had the motor on the block testing its power."},{"Quote":"When I design and wonder what the point is, I think of someone having a bad time in their life. Maybe they are sad and they wake up and put on something I have made and it makes them feel just a bit better. So, in that sense, fashion is a little help in the life of a person. But only a little."},{"Quote":"I would urge everyone to start looking at the world in a different way. Spend some time looking at everyday objects, at their design, their shape, their individual characteristics. Think ahead and imagine their significance."},{"Quote":"The best design work is really done when you spend more time with people, when you have the opportunity to be of the same mindset and the same incentives as the founder of the business."},{"Quote":"As an artist, as I design and lay out a page, the less-important things, things I want you to spend less time looking at, I draw them very small, maybe even silhouette them.

I think of our customers all the time. There is no virtue whatsoever in creating clothing or accessories that are not practical."},{"Quote":"If you want to communicate something, you'd better make sure that your design piece is well-dressed and that its teeth are fixed. At the same time, I still believe that if it is only stylistically great and it has nothing to say, it still is not going to make a lasting impression on anybody."},{"Quote":"So if I want to buy a light in a shop and I don't find a light that I like, I think to myself what would I like? What would I like to buy? Then I started to imagine and design it for myself a lot of the time."},{"Quote":"I'm not like most designers, who have to set sail on an exotic getaway to get inspired. Most of the time, it's on my walk to work, or sitting in the subway and seeing something random or out of context."},{"Quote":"I learned that the first technology appeared in the form of stone tools, 2.6 million years ago. First entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are 35,000 years old. And evidence for first design comes 75,000 years old - beads. And you can do the same with your genes and track them back in time."},{"Quote":"There is a design behind the world that we are living in, which is veiled to most of us most of the time, but every once in a while, you catch a glimpse of it."},{"Quote":"There are so many women throughout the world who appreciate beautiful design and have the budget to buy designer fashion but sometimes have a hard time finding the things that they really want or that suit their lifestyle or their culture or whatever it may be."},{"Quote":"If you depend on a secret for your security, what do you do when the secret is discovered? If it is easy to change, like a cryptographic key, you do so. If it's hard to change, like a cryptographic system or an operating system, you're stuck. You will be vulnerable until you invest the time and money to design another system."},{"Quote":"The typical project design time for a large company like IBM - and they keep track of this - is a little over four years."},{"Quote":"I have too much product, and I'm trying to rein it in and sell more of my main collection. I wish you didn't have to design so often; it would be good if you could keep on selling the same things for a few years and not have to do new things all the time."},{"Quote":"We spent a lot of time trend forecasting and collaborating on ways to design a fresh line of fashion-forward, affordable luxury."},{"Quote":"Eight years of work can be copied in six months. It wasn't inevitable that it was going to work. A stolen design is stolen time."},{"Quote":"Can you design a Rorschach test that's going to make everyone feel something every time - and that looks like a Rorschach test? It's easy to show a picture of a kitten or a car accident. The question is, how abstract can you get and still get the audience to feel something when they don't know what's happening to them?"},{"Quote":"By no definition of any modern scientist is intelligent design science, and it's a waste of our students' time to subject them to it."},{"Quote":"From time to time, I've experimented with sculpture or metal design. It's a good break from just sitting behind the keyboard."},{"Quote":"My stylist has really great taste - Petra Flannery has really great taste. I mean, I am opinionated, and as time goes on, as I've gotten to see more dresses or more clothes, it's easier to say, 'I like that' or 'I don't like that,' but it's nothing I would ever, you know, design."},{"Quote":"I can create clothes for so many different time periods. I've always tried to avoid being pigeonholed. Plus, everything I learn about design and costume from one movie somehow works its way into something else."},{"Quote":"Keep it simple, stupid. Good game design shouldn't keep you looking at the manual but should have enough depth where you feel like you bring something new to the game every time you play."},{"Quote":"I learn my lines while on the golf course. I try to do two or three things at once. I have ideas for books all the time, I have ideas for paintings all the time, and I write them all down. I take my sketchpad and my iPad, which I design on, and I do sit down and do specific tasks at specific times."},{"Quote":"I went to high school in Ellicott City, Maryland, and I felt pretty ambivalent about the whole thing. It just took time away from my doing things on the Internet - like creating clans in Quake II or starting a Web design nonprofit. In school, I was just a kid. Online, I had authority."},{"Quote":"Each time I invent something and have it manufactured, it's so incredibly exciting that I can't imagine ever wanting to stop. Envisioning new products is easy for me. I just don't have enough time in the day to design them all."},{"Quote":"I have always been fascinated by the way things work and how they came to take the form that they did. Writing about these things satisfies my curiosity about the made world while at the same time giving me an opportunity to design a new explanation for the processes that shape it."},{"Quote":"I love fashion, and I've always wanted to do costume design, but I'm in jeans and T-shirts most of the time."},{"Quote":"I was in college, and very disappointed. I majored in commercial art and interior design for three or four years. At that time, it seemed the thing I really wanted to do, production design, just wasn't available in the U.K., so I turned to music."},{"Quote":"You can get the best locksmith in the world to design the best lock he can design, is it pick proof? No, it's not: it can be very hard to pick, but it is pickable. Because you can get, say, the next 10 best locksmiths, and give them unlimited money and time, they will figure out a way to pick it."},{"Quote":"I was asked to design the tuxedo for Mr. Peanut. They're rebranding him. That was probably the most interesting request. I didn't spend a long time considering it."},{"Quote":"I was going to design sports cars, but my father came to my college to visit me. At the time he was making a picture in Sweden and he took me there with him. I got to see Ingmar Bergman's company and I thought, 'Gee, filmmaking is a lot more fun than sports cars,' so I decided to follow him and go into acting."},{"Quote":"Design schools are good, I guess, sometimes I visit schools, but they are very very limiting."},{"Quote":"I wouldn't say design has become strictly functional. A lot of cars these days look downright comic book to me, and the info-gadgets with which late industrial people spend the most time - phones, music players, etc. - are blobjects."},{"Quote":"My architectural drive was to design new types of buildings to help poor people, especially following natural disasters and catastrophes... I will use whatever time is left to me to keep doing what I have been doing, which is to help humanity."},{"Quote":"Bring a wife home to your house when you are of the right age, not far short of 30 years, nor much above; this is the right time for marriage."},{"Quote":"There was a time in the marriage when I could no longer look at myself in a mirror, couldn't feel I was a nice person. A bad relationship can do that, can make you doubt everything good you ever felt about yourself."},{"Quote":"The United States is in a time of transition. Courts have redefined marriage, and beliefs about human sexuality are changing. Will the right to dissent be protected? Will the right of Americans to speak and act in accord with what the United States had always believed about marriage - that it's a union of husband and wife - be tolerated?"},{"Quote":"When you are young, do not get involved in steady dating. When you reach an age where you think of marriage, then is the time to become so involved."},{"Quote":"Marriage is the highest state of friendship. If happy, it lessens our cares by dividing them, at the same time that it doubles our pleasures by mutual participation."},{"Quote":"Religious institutions should have religious freedom on this issue. No church or minister should ever have to conduct a marriage that is inconsistent with their religious beliefs. But I think as a civil institution, this issue's time has come and we need to move forward."},{"Quote":"I was totally surprised by the spread of the legalization of same-sex marriage. In just my lifetime we have gone from a taboo to even talk about homosexuality, to the sanction by governments of homosexual marriage. Few such large social considerations have ever before been turned over in such a short time."},{"Quote":"I'm 58 years old. I got married for the first time - it's about time, right? Growing up as a gay woman, you just don't ever think about that, and then I thought, about 10 years ago, 'You know, I think within 10 years gay marriage will be legal.' And here we are, 10 years later, making it legal."},{"Quote":"Marrying a man is like buying something you've been admiring for a long time in a shop window. You may love it when you get it home, but it doesn't always go with everything else in the house."},{"Quote":"I think women are natural caretakers. They take care of everybody. They take care of their husbands and their kids and their dogs, and don't spend a lot of time just getting back and taking time out."},{"Quote":"Sometimes divorce is better than marriage."},{"Quote":"I've exchanged messages and photos of an explicit nature with about six women over the last three years. For the most part, these communications took place before my marriage, though some have sadly took place after. To be clear, I have never met any of these women or had physical relationships at any time."},{"Quote":"Brands mature over time, like a marriage. The bond you feel with your spouse is different than when you first met each other. Excitement and discovery are replaced by comfort and depth."},{"Quote":"My music is about where I am at the time. In 'Raymond vs. Raymond,' I was going through a lot of things, and it came out in my music. My marriage fell apart, and I was suddenly a single father."},{"Quote":"I think there was a time in my life, probably in college, that I wished every guy was gay because it meant more women for me! I don't know what everyone's problem with it is. I wish everyone was gay! That's always the way I thought about it. I have no issue with it. If I have to suffer through marriage, why shouldn't they?"},{"Quote":"My view is that marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman. That's the position I've had for some time, and I don't intend to make any adjustments at this point... Or ever, by the way."},{"Quote":"Culture, what you believe, what you value, how you live matters. Now, as fundamental as these principles are, they may become topics of democratic debates from time to time, so it is today with the enduring institution of marriage. Marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman."},{"Quote":"One of the things, one of the things that really got to me was the thing in Houston where you had the government, the mayor actually, trying to get the sermons of ministers. When the government tries to invade the church to enforce its own opinion on marriage, that's when it's time to resist."},{"Quote":"Men have a much better time of it than women. For one thing, they marry later; for another thing, they die earlier."},{"Quote":"I was never against marriage per se. Before feminism, I didn't think you had any choice. In fact, for a long time I always assumed I would get married. I just didn't see any marriages I wanted to emulate, so I kept putting it off."},{"Quote":"We cannot insist only on issues related to abortion, gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods. The teaching of the church is clear, and I am a son of the church, but it is not necessary to talk about these issues all the time."},{"Quote":"Sometimes I bust out and do things so permanent. Like tattoos and marriage."},{"Quote":"It took me a long time to be convinced that marriage was right for me because I've come from a long line of broken marriages. My parents divorced, and I had two broken marriages myself."},{"Quote":"Men are literally lying in bed with their wives when the marriage is essentially over, thinking, 'I've got to get the hell out of here', and have a fantasy woman in mind. Then you get divorced, meet a woman, marry her, and by the time all that goes by, you've aged a few years and are ready to go back to your ex-wife."},{"Quote":"By the time I had reached the age of 16, in the 10th grade, my parents, after 22 years of marriage, one day decided to get a divorce."},{"Quote":"Once I found professional happiness, it gave me time to think about other areas in my life in which I wasn't happy. The next obvious candidate for introspection was my marriage."},{"Quote":"I think it's best if there's an amendment that goes on the ballot where the people can weigh in. Every time this issue has gone on the ballot, the people have voted to retain the traditional definition of marriage as recently as California in 2008."},{"Quote":"At the time of my second marriage, my husband was in his early 50s, I was in my mid-40s, and we each had two kids. We maintained our individual accounts and opened one for the house. We each kick the same percentage of our incomes into the house account and have a joint credit card. But we pay for our children separately."},{"Quote":"The funny thing about 'Take Shelter' is that a lot of people talk about how it was allegory for the economy and things that were to happen. And that was so on the nose in the movie for me. I was like, 'That's obvious.' It's the other stuff about marriage and commitment and those other things that I spent the most time thinking about."},{"Quote":"Marriage can be tricky and challenging at times."},{"Quote":"There's already a marriage clock, a career clock, a biological clock. Sometimes being a woman feels like standing in the lobby of a hotel, looking at the dials depicting every time zone in the world behind the front desk - except they all apply to you, and all at once."},{"Quote":"Gay rights is just a matter of time. Look at the polls. Worrying about gay marriage, let alone gay civil unions or gay employment rights, is a middle-age issue. Young people just can't see the problem. At worst, gays are going to win this one just by waiting until the opposition dies off."},{"Quote":"Gay marriage will be universally accepted in time. But if I may be so bold as to say to gays and lesbians, don't wait for that time to arrive. Just as my father and his generation did not 'wait' for their civil rights, nor should you. The toothpaste ain't going back in the tube. The tide has turned."},{"Quote":"Like everything which is not the involuntary result of fleeting emotion but the creation of time and will, any marriage, happy or unhappy, is infinitely more interesting than any romance, however passionate."},{"Quote":"One of the favorite conservative themes is that the cure for poverty is more marriage and earlier marriage. We hear that all the time; there have been billions of dollars now, between the Bush administration and the Obama administration, which has continued the marriage education program, on trying to get more people to get married."},{"Quote":"If you like a man and he likes you, you should get married as fast as you can. Otherwise, you both are going to change your minds. There's plenty of time for that after marriage."},{"Quote":"I've had an exciting time I married for love and got a little money along with it."},{"Quote":"Often it's a lack of time, not taste, that leads someone to hire a decorator. A good decorator/client relationship should be like a marriage. The time one puts in needs to be extensive. One needs to listen to them and understand what they like and how they live."},{"Quote":"I was made to believe there was a plan in place for ending Donald's previous marriage. I pulled away because I wanted to allow him the time to deal with his wife."},{"Quote":"In France, I guess there's something like a tyranny in mentalities - we accept success badly, beauty, money. People are certainly envious, and this creates negative energy. This is annoying. I suffered a great deal at one time. I had to fight harder than others. Add to that my marriage to Polanski."},{"Quote":"Time turns the old days to derision, Our loves into corpses or wives; And marriage and death and division Make barren our lives."},{"Quote":"There's as much crookedness as you want to find. There was something Abraham Lincoln said - he'd rather trust and be disappointed than distrust and be miserable all the time. Maybe I trusted too much."},{"Quote":"Trust has to be earned, and should come only after the passage of time."},{"Quote":"Live-tweeting your bikini wax is not vulnerability. Nor is posting a blow-by-blow of your divorce . That's an attempt to hot-wire connection. But you can't cheat real connection. It's built up slowly.

Then 40 years later if you performed the same exercise, less than 10% of the public believed it was true. The fracturing of trust is based on the fact that the consumer has been let down."},{"Quote":"The violations of these diesel motors by our company go against everything that Volkswagen stands for... at this time, I don't yet have the answers to all the questions. I'm utterly sorry that we have damaged trust in this way. I offer my deepest apologies to our customers, the authorities, and to the public at large for our misconduct."},{"Quote":"I trust if your life is right, the right things will happen at the right time. If the chords are in harmony inside, I think other things will happen in the same way. That sounded highfalutin' to me once, but I believe it now."},{"Quote":"Prenups are so unromantic - a sign of distrust, not love. Time for a reality check, my friends. First, drawing up a prenuptial agreement together is a sign of incredible trust and financial openness - you're fooling yourself if you think you can achieve complete intimacy without it."},{"Quote":"There was a time when the United States government earned the trust of its people.

They're so used to not believing adults - because adults tell tales and lies all the time."},{"Quote":"Newspapers with declining circulations can complain all they want about their readers and even say they have no taste. But you will still go out of business over time. A newspaper is not a public trust - it has a business model that either works or it doesn't."},{"Quote":"When Arizona became a state, the federal government granted our founders nearly 11 million acres of state land.

I trust my accountant because we have worked together for a long time now."},{"Quote":"There's not a lot of time to have conversations on the field during the game.

When I sold phones, the same thing happened, but this time I was ready."},{"Quote":"I put quite a few trees in last autumn. A lot of silver birch and a couple of native trees - just generally doing gardening, putting plants in and hedges in. It takes quite a lot of time and I love it."},{"Quote":"Every time I imagine a garden in an architectural setting, it turns into a magical place.

But for that brief idyllic time in 1910, Hollywood looked like the perfect place for a successful writer to settle down, build his dream house, and maybe do some gardening."},{"Quote":"It's my observation that gardeners and gardening for a very long time have had to take a back seat. Architects are very famous they've got huge projects. What goes on in and around them has been relegated to a very minor role."},{"Quote":"There's something about beautiful moments in sports that alters our experience of time.

Seventy-four per cent of the time."},{"Quote":"I heard that people were really interested in the new haircut, which I think is so funny. Great haircut, I really like it.

I'm very, very much done with that."},{"Quote":"Latinos, Asians, African-Americans, women - we're all trying to find our place in this world of cinema and television and theater. And the great thing with comedy is that most of the time, you could be orange.

And it's had a difficult time with many components of the Romantic imagination because of modernism."},{"Quote":"Don't stay at the job for safe salary increases over time.

The last time I tried watching was the last Super Bowl. The problem I have is, you know, the graphic nature of my imagination; when I watch and see them meeting head onto head, helmet onto helmet, what flashes through my mind is what's going on in their brains. It's like torture to me."},{"Quote":"The artist's job is to be a witness to his time in history."},{"Quote":"What goes on in abstract art is the proclaiming of aesthetic principles...

When these values are exhausted the pictures are forgotten, and the more a picture has to give, the greater it is."},{"Quote":"People were more interested in the phenomena than the art itself.

Now I believe it is time for others to take the baton that was passed to me following the crash. I have therefore decided to leave political life at the end of this term."},{"Quote":"Politics - I still think it's a bunch of liars and a bunch of self-interest. It's not about the people: it's about themselves and their rise to power. They are voting on things based on whether they will have the support of the people when they vote next time. They don't have the balls to say, 'I believe in this. I don't care what happens.'"},{"Quote":"One thing that education can do is it can provide us with an opportunity to understand one another better, and so while I've spent a lot of my time in the world of politics, I've always felt that it is really not politics that will solve this for us."},{"Quote":"Promising something that seems popular at the time that you know you're never going to deliver - that's the kind of cynical politics that I don't want any part of."},{"Quote":"The arts community is generally dominated by liberals because if you are concerned mainly with painting or sculpture, you don't have time to study how the world works.

I was just sad and just felt like something was missing."},{"Quote":"All pictures are unnatural. All pictures are sad because they're about dead people. Paintings you don't think of in a special time or with a specific event. With photos I always think I'm looking at something dead."},{"Quote":"My thing with fans is, it's always about being really good to them and taking the time to take every picture. If there are 300 people, you should take 300 pictures - you shouldn't take 250 because then fifty people will go home sad. Why would you do that?"},{"Quote":"The first series I wrote, 'L.A.

When I walk into the meet-and-greet, someone's always going to have a story, a sad story or a happy story."},{"Quote":"It makes me very sad. Everyone's afraid of each other - Jews are afraid of Palestinians, Palestinians are afraid of Jews. Everywhere I see fear, not understanding. Reason went out of the window a long time ago."},{"Quote":"Sad to say, multi-tasking is beyond me. I read one book at a time all the way through. If I'm reviewing the book, I have to write the review before I start reading any other book.

Americans were deeply frightened, sad, and angry, and they rallied around a President who, at the time, showed impressive certitude and calm."},{"Quote":"I allow myself to not feel the need to be some sort of wonder woman.

This makes me so sad, because many times they will tell me, 'Television won't like, so we have to cut, cut, cut!'"},{"Quote":"We've got people looking at our seamy side and our sad side a lot of the time because that's easier.

It's impossible but, at the same time, you still hope. You think, 'Maybe I can do it,' but you know you can't.

I really did not."},{"Quote":"There was a study done in the early 20th century of all the entrepreneurs who entered the automobile industry around the same time as Henry Ford; there were something like 500 automotive companies that got funded, had the internal combustion engine, had the technology, and had the vision.

You're not constrained by what you can do, in terms of the special effects technology. You're not limited to any particular running time."},{"Quote":"I love technology. Matches, to light a fire, is really high tech. The wheel is really one of the great inventions of all time.

Technology over time will reduce demand for jobs, particularly at the lower end of skill set."},{"Quote":"Our first challenge is to ensure safety of pilgrims, and we will use modern technology for that. We will strengthen our telecom network and will provide special mobile apps to the pilgrims at the time of registration."},{"Quote":"You just have to adapt, and you have to realize where people are going to actually play their games.

But there was a time when we hadn't worked out how many legs chairs should have, how tall they should be, and they would often 'crash' when we tried to use them."},{"Quote":"The biggest invention of modern time is the book. The book is a digital medium; book text is written in a different form and replicable. What it really does is it allows us to replicate cultural information, scientific technology, and information out of the human brain."},{"Quote":"It's counterproductive to lower my price, because I have to sell more units to make up for that lost revenue. Generating brand-new products can take a long time. Improving service is typically the quickest way that I can take market share. So aligning technology strategy to better service customers becomes an essential path to revenue growth."},{"Quote":"Technology has changed the fan/actor interaction quite a bit. Now it's really easy to communicate with a large group of people in a really short time, and that... opens a lot of possibilities. You can do a lot of things with it that you couldn't do before.

She said, 'I love it when you talk equipment to me.'"},{"Quote":"Technology is neutral and sterile. Now, technology is the nature of modern man; it is our environment and our horizon. Of course, every work of man is a negation of nature, but at the same time, it is a bridge between nature and us. Technology changes nature in a more radical and decisive manner: it throws it out."},{"Quote":"I started in comics in 2005, ten years ago, and at that time, I didn't have a cell phone. I don't even think I had a computer myself, you know. And just in those ten years, how much technology has changed."},{"Quote":"Every time a new technology comes along, we feel we're about to break through to a place where we will not be able to recover. The advent of broadcast radio confused people. It delighted people, of course, but it also changed the world."},{"Quote":"The telephone is a 100-year-old technology. It's time for a change.

At the same time it's a blessing in the fact that you do get noticed. People tend to remember you as the only woman in the room 'who said that', or the only woman in the room who was an engineer."},{"Quote":"When are boots in the ground no longer going to have to even be people, and is that right? When does it become 'Star Wars?' When is enough enough? When do we put this time and energy into eliminating war or reasons for war instead of creating new technology to make war easier for us?"},{"Quote":"I'm a farm boy. I would rather live in that time when you had to provide for your family. I don't know. I'm a country kid, so I don't like modern technology."},{"Quote":"We are finally entering an exciting time in medicine where we have the technology to custom-tailor treatment and preventive protocols just as we'd custom-tailor a suit or designer gown to one's individual body. But it all begins with you. You have to know yourself in a manner that you've probably never done before."},{"Quote":"I think that's the phenomenon of our time is that a lot of women keep themselves in good shape but that there's not a lot of accommodation or people out there to connect with and the technology."},{"Quote":"I worked in information technology and academia for a long time and met many people who were better with things and ideas than with people."},{"Quote":"Learn from the past, set vivid, detailed goals for the future, and live in the only moment of time over which you have any control: now."},{"Quote":"I was perceived to be a first- to third-rounder.

It was crazy; it wasn't greedy. It was mine, my girl's, my mom's. I got Benzes for my ladies. But I felt crazy. You have to understand I come from a world where we're very modest. But that's not greedy. That's nice, right?"},{"Quote":"I always speak so highly of my mom because she's my partner in crime, and none of this would be possible without her love and support. Always have to make time for Mom."},{"Quote":"As others have recently suggested, the term 'gamer' is no longer useful as an identity because games are for everyone. These days, even my mom spends an inordinate amount of time gaming on her iPad. So I'll take a cue from my younger self and say I don't care about being a 'gamer,' but I sure do love video games."},{"Quote":"Mom spent the time that she was supposed to be a kid actully raising children, her younger brother and younger sister. She was tough as nails and did not suffer fools at all. And the truth was she could not afford to. She spoke the truth, bluntly, directly, and without much varnish. I am her son."},{"Quote":"Boxing is individual, although there's a team concept because you need a great corner, you need a great trainer, you need a great prep man, you need all of these things, but it's more of a Mano a Mano; it's more you versus me. I miss that time in training camp and Dad and Mom cooking meals. It was one big family."},{"Quote":"Definitely there are lots of days that l am really tired, especially after becoming a new mom. There's nothing more exhausting because physically, mentally, emotionally, it requires you to be on all the time."},{"Quote":"My parents told me from the time I can remember that, 'Yeah, you're adopted.

She was like, 'Oh, you're adopted, but I wish I had pretty brown skin like you.'"},{"Quote":"I think it's a tough road if you're a stay-at-home mom, a working mom, if you have a partner, if you don't. It's the best job in the world, and the toughest job in the world all at the same time."},{"Quote":"I want to thank my mom, Brenda Rose. My heart, the reason I play the way I play, just everything. Just knowing the days I don't feel right, going to practice, having a hard time, I think about her when she had to wake me up, go to work and make sure I was all right. Those were hard days."},{"Quote":"One-year-olds learn concealment. Five-year-olds lie outright: they manipulate via flattery. Nine-year-olds - masters of the cover-up. By the time you enter college, you're going to lie to your mom in one out of every five interactions."},{"Quote":"The best part about playing a mom is that people hug moms. I get hugs all the time. It really makes hard days a lot easier, and easy days are downright joyous."},{"Quote":"My mom was concerned that us four little black girls have a really well-balanced life.

Now I spend most of my time chasing wisdom, chasing understanding."},{"Quote":"For many women, going back to work a few months after having a baby is overwhelming and unmanageable.

Maybe she steered me in that direction. You know, because she was really so ahead of her time."},{"Quote":"My mom always taught me to put toothpaste on pimples to dry them out at night.

Her mom was, I think, 17 or 18 when she was born; my mom was 15 when I was born.

But when you haven't taken the time to get to know yourself, be OK with you, and articulate what it is you want in a relationship, then you can't possibly find that person for you because you don't even know what you're looking for."},{"Quote":"The grief of losing my father has come in waves over the years, as it does with most people. His love and devotion as a father provided my closest, most intimate relationship. Dad, and our time together, is in my bones. While reflecting on him, the memories themselves seem to boil down into certain 'essences of Dad.'"},{"Quote":"When you're watching television, you don't want to watch a show where everything just works out.

Yes, they would love to find a lasting relationship, but it's not likely to happen the way they are going about it."},{"Quote":"There's never been a game plan, and I suppose I've had an uneasy relationship with my ambition. Someone who had been in my year at drama school once said to me that I was terrifyingly ambitious back then. Which was not at all what I felt at the time - I felt paralysed with shyness, though that evaporated."},{"Quote":"I really enjoy being single again. I spent a lot of time in a relationship and the nearer we came to the end, the more difficult it got.

I made a decision there and then that it was what I wanted to do. Every time I pulled a wishbone, it was what I asked for."},{"Quote":"I admire 'Adventure Time' for being a piece of art in the way that I think art should be.

I also just have no confidence. And you know what? I don't have time, because I'd rather be doing other things, like knitting."},{"Quote":"A definition of poetry can only determine what poetry should be and not what poetry actually was and is otherwise the most concise formula would be: Poetry is that which at some time and some place was thus named."},{"Quote":"I used to spend a lot of time dreaming and writing poetry."},{"Quote":"Listeners are kind of ambushed... if a poem just happens to be said when they're listening to the radio. The listener doesn't have time to deploy what I call their 'poetry deflector shields' that were installed in high school - there's little time to resist the poem."},{"Quote":"I love poetry. I love rhyming. Do you know, there are poets who don't rhyme? Shakespeare did not rhyme most of the time, and that's why I do not like him."},{"Quote":"I don't think poetry will die, but I think that poetry does demand a certain kind of attention to language. It does demand a certain space in order to read it, and I think that space is somewhat threatened by the lack of attention that people have and the amount of time that they give to things."},{"Quote":"Poetry takes place in time. It is a durational. Things take place in sequence."},{"Quote":"Fiction is supposed to be immersive and supposed to be entertaining and narrative, so structures have to be buried a little bit. If they come foregrounded too much, it stops being fiction and starts being poetry - something more concrete and out of time."},{"Quote":"Poetry was one of the things that interested me most as I was growing up. I used to write it in my head all the time. I still think the very greatest pleasure in life is to write a poem."},{"Quote":"'Words and Music' on Radio 3 is always a treat.

Later you can look it up online, but at the time you can't cheat."},{"Quote":"I read usually in the morning, in my kitchen at breakfast - a short reading time, usually poetry.

I usually get in bed pretty early with a book, and I read until I can't prop my eyes open anymore - sometimes rather late."},{"Quote":"I always loved singing and writing poetry. I always loved music, and I've loved writing my whole life. When I put them together, it was probably in my early 20s where I put words to music for the first time."},{"Quote":"I read a little bit of nonfiction and a lot of poetry.

I feared every time I talked about poetry, it would be filtered through the lens of race, sex, and age."},{"Quote":"I love to compare different time frames. Poetry can evoke the time of the subject. By a very careful choice of words you can evoke an era, completely throw the poem into a different time scale."},{"Quote":"Some people think that English poetry begins with the Anglo-Saxons. I don't, because I can't accept that there is any continuity between the traditions of Anglo-Saxon poetry and those established in English poetry by the time of, say, Shakespeare.

But I'm a white girl, not going to be a rapper."},{"Quote":"I write all the time - I write poetry, I love to write."},{"Quote":"My favorite subject probably was math. I love math.

Although it can be hard at times, it's important for women to recognize the benefits of working outside the home."},{"Quote":"You have to be very insensitive in order to have a cat, because I think they're very independent.

If you can't have a good time, you might as well stay home. I feel real good."},{"Quote":"When I got home from hospital, and I was in a wheelchair in a plaster body cast, an aeroplane flew over. And I thought to myself, 'Well, if I can't walk, then I might as well fly.' And I was lifted into the aeroplane for the first time.

They need not be important; quite insignificant actions fulfill the same purpose."},{"Quote":"My sister Naomi and I always wanted to go to Tahiti. We planned a fantastic holiday to visit several islands, but at the last moment, Naomi cancelled.

They don't often think about social and environmental impact because they're focused on their financial bottom line."},{"Quote":"Nature is regulating our climate for free.

'Time' magazine designated me as one of the environmental heroes of the 20th century. Oh, and I've got some honorary citizenships, like from the Conch Republic of the Florida Keys. But the one thing I am proud of is I didn't get the Chevron environmental award.

But they have a hard time competing with facilities overseas that have few, if any, environmental and safety standards."},{"Quote":"The industrial processes in use today were developed at a time when no one had to consider what the environmental impact was.

So all women somehow, being repressed for so many millennia, they ended up by developing this sixth sense and contemplation and love.

It must be done one human being at a time. Without that kind of help, Western society does not allow people to come to terms with their feelings. With honesty and therapy, my people can be made whole again."},{"Quote":"Homer, Hesiod, Pythagoras, Plato, and Cicero, just to name a few, all lived in pagan societies.

They should just be able to come."},{"Quote":"Legal discrimination between the sexes is, in almost every instance, founded on outmoded views of society and the pre-scientific beliefs about psychology and physiology. It is time to sweep away these relics of the past and set further generations free of them."},{"Quote":"There comes a time when a human being has to either face evil or admit to allowing it. Abortion is legal in the United States, but it should not be celebrated or used as a political tool. Viable babies are human beings."},{"Quote":"The history of American democracy, to say the least, has been checkered. Our nation was founded at a time when people of African descent were held in bondage. After slavery was abolished, they were forced to endure legal discrimination for another 100 years."},{"Quote":"Death Row inmates are almost twice as expensive to house each year as other inmates.

On that test, Elena Kagan fails."},{"Quote":"In high school - that's when I first fell in love with his music and his voice. 'Blonde on Blonde' above everything.

Nor does a corporation, in legal language, have any 'posterity.'"},{"Quote":"Look at liberty's greatest historic advances: ending slavery. Giving women the vote. Outlawing legal segregation.

She will find her own sphere in accordance with her capacities, powers and tastes; and yet she will be woman still."},{"Quote":"With the death of bin Laden, it's finally time for Congress to bring back the pre-9-11 legal norm, before we decided it was okay to toss out our civil liberties if the 'bad guys' were scary enough."},{"Quote":"I'm always writing something.

I had a TV show that had gotten cancelled. Basically, I rented a wedding gown; the reception hall smelled like feet."},{"Quote":"I think that weddings have probably been crashed since the beginning of time. Cavemen crashed them. You go to meet girls. It makes sense."},{"Quote":"So many little girls dream about their wedding day. But with actresses, sometimes it's the inverse, because we get to be the centre of attention, looked up and down, dressed up for premieres all the time.

I became with friends with designer Irene Neuwirth a few years ago. At that point, I just used to wear my wedding rings. Very low key. Now, if I could, I'd be draped from head to toe in her jewelry all the time. Everything she makes is beautiful."},{"Quote":"I haven't made many wedding dresses. It's a dress very, very important for the girl; it's important to know the person, I believe, but at the same time it should be a shock to the person - the person should be shocked to be suddenly revealed. That's the work of a designer sometimes, to propose an ID of look."},{"Quote":"Well the wedding in the words of the Archbishop of Canterbury was a fairy tale and there was a huge public impress, investment of goodwill, affection and indeed money in this Institution. It was a huge success at the time."},{"Quote":"Sure, men like a challenge - but so do women. And nobody likes to be challenged all the time.

They were special people in addition to what their natural yearnings were."},{"Quote":"Analysis gave me great freedom of emotions and fantastic confidence. I felt I had served my time as a puppet."},{"Quote":"I think the most fun part about working on 'Good Luck Charlie' is spending time with everyone, honestly, because everybody on set is like my brother and sister and mom and dad. They're so fun to be around, so that's probably the best part about working there."},{"Quote":"After my parents' divorce when I was 4, I spent weekends with my dad before we finally moved to California.

The time pressure on talking to your father!"},{"Quote":"I actually hated hunting the first time I went when I was a kid. My dad took us deer hunting.

I needed something that would mellow me out."},{"Quote":"I'm from Santa Cruz in Northern California, and the 49ers were my dad and I's bonding time."},{"Quote":"Within our culture, every school has a swimming pool.

What remained was the slavery to a pattern."},{"Quote":"Ah, my dad's whistle. On holidays when I was a kid, we would all be off in the rock pools along the beach.

Every time."},{"Quote":"I remember when I was younger. Dad's agent came round, and I asked if she would represent me.

I've always been quite headstrong."},{"Quote":"Ask anyone on Social Security if their check comes on time every month. Like clockwork. And it comes through the so-called dilapidated U.S. mail. My dad's check literally will come on the same day every month. The government has been quite good and efficient at creating a number of systems."},{"Quote":"My dad was never married. He was kind of a rolling stone. But he was never disrespectful. At the same time, even though he had women in his life when I was a kid, there wasn't any consistency."},{"Quote":"I get that same queasy, nervous, thrilling feeling every time I go to work.

It was like, OK, I get it now. I know what fatherhood is all about. And you look at your parents differently."},{"Quote":"Roman history was kind of unavoidable where I was growing up. It was everywhere - all the place names and ruins and forts. My dad's a history buff, and I spent a lot of time on Hadrian's Wall.

I just need enough time to screw things up and then I'll start looking to TV dads for advice."},{"Quote":"As soon as I was tall enough, my dad used to let me drive him 60 miles or 70 miles to work.

I guess I didn't find it to be that crazy."},{"Quote":"I actually wanted to be a police officer like my dad for the longest time, up until my sophomore year in high school when I started doing plays.
