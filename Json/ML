    "Questions": "Agglomerative Clustering",
    "Answers": "Agglomerative clustering is also known as bottom-up approach or hierarchical agglomerative clustering (hac). A structure that is more informative than the unstructured set of clusters returned by flat clustering. This clustering algorithm does not require us to prespecify the number of clusters. Bottom-up algorithms treat each data as a singleton cluster at the outset and then successively agglomerates pairs of clusters until all clusters have been merged into a single cluster that contains all data."

    "Answers": "Bagging is used when the goal is to reduce the variance of a decision tree classifier. Here the objective is to create several subsets of data from training sample chosen randomly with replacement. Each collection of subset data is used to train their decision trees. As a result, we get an ensemble of different models. Average of all the predictions from different trees are used which is more robust than a single decision tree classifier."

  },
  {
    "Questions": "Bias-variance trade off",
    "Answers": "If the bias of a model is decreased, the variance of the model automatically increases. The vice-versa is also true, that is if the variance of a model decreases, bias starts to increase. Hence, it can be concluded that it is nearly impossible to have a model with no bias or no variance since decreasing one increases the other. This phenomenon is known as the bias-variance trade"

    "Questions": "Boosting",
    "Answers": "Boosting is used to create a collection of predictors. In this technique, learners are learned sequentially with early learners fitting simple models to the data and then analysing data for errors. Consecutive trees (random sample) are fit and at every step, the goal is to improve the accuracy from the prior tree. When an input is misclassified by a hypothesis, its weight is increased so that next hypothesis is more likely to classify it correctly. This process converts weak learners into better performing model."

  {
    "Questions": "True Positive Rate",
    "Answers": "Recall gives us an idea about when it's actually yes, how often does it predict yes. It is also called as sensitivity or recall or hit rate. TPR = tp / ( tp + fn )"

  },
  {
    "Questions": "Underfitting",
    "Answers": "When the complexity of the model is too less for it to learn the data that is given as input, the model is said to “underfit”. In other words, the excessively simple model fails to “learn” the intricate patterns and underlying trends of the given dataset. Underfitting occurs for a model with low variance and high bias."
  },
  {
    "Questions": "Variance",
    "Answers": "Variance occurs when the model performs good on the trained dataset but does not do well on a dataset that it is not trained on, like a test dataset or validation dataset."

    "Questions": "False Positive Ratio",
    "Answers": "It is the ratio of all negative classes predicted incorrectly, that is predicted as positive divided by all the classes actually as negative. It is also called as fall-out. FPR = FP / ( FP + TN )"

    "Questions": "Selection Bias",
    "Answers": "Selection bias is usually introduced as an error with the sampling and having a selection for analysis that is not properly randomized"

    "Questions": "unsupervised learning",
    "Answers": "Unsupervised learning is where you only have input data ( x ) and no corresponding output variable. It is called unsupervised learning because unlike supervised learning there is no labelled data that means no correct answer or no teacher."
